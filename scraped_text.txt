A Message from Our CFO

In FY22, WWF continued to build a better future for people and nature. All of our work is enabled by your support—at every level, every day. As our approaches, strategies, and efforts evolved to meet the many conservation crises we face, WWF delivered significant progress toward the protection and resilience of nature. This year, in fact, spending on conservation programs increased by 11%. In FY22, the organization raised $433 million with commitments from both private and public donors, a 15% increase over FY21. We are incredibly grateful for your support as our efforts on behalf of people and planet continue to grow.
The contributions reported here mirror WWF’s audited financial statements. All bookable contributions, including cash and pledges received for future years, are reflected in the revenue shown. FY22 contributions revenue includes the bookable portion ($14 million) of our extraordinary partnership with HP, $16 million for the Heritage Colombia Projects for Permanence, and a $10 million gift for our Renewable Thermal Collaborative. When we receive these exceptional multiyear gifts, including the $100 million grant from the Bezos Earth Fund in FY21 for climate-focused funding, it may create the appearance of a large surplus of revenue over expenses in a given year. These contributions will be spent down over several years, which may result in the appearance of a deficit of operating revenue over operating expense in subsequent years.

Transparency and Accountability
WWF holds a deep commitment to transparency and accountability. We carefully manage our resources to maximize the funding that goes toward our science-driven program work. Donors will receive updates and communications from WWF and can opt-out at any time. 82% of WWF’s spending is directed to worldwide conservation activities, while 12% is utilized for fundraising and 6% goes toward finance and administration. We communicate with our supporters by postal mail and other channels to educate the public and advance the cause of conservation, as well as to generate income and maintain our membership base. As a result, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines, our direct mail costs are divided between public education to advance conservation and fundraising.

A Message from Our CFO

In FY22, WWF continued to build a better future for people and nature. All of our work is enabled by your support—at every level, every day. As our approaches, strategies, and efforts evolved to meet the many conservation crises we face, WWF delivered significant progress toward the protection and resilience of nature. This year, in fact, spending on conservation programs increased by 11%. In FY22, the organization raised $433 million with commitments from both private and public donors, a 15% increase over FY21. We are incredibly grateful for your support as our efforts on behalf of people and planet continue to grow.
The contributions reported here mirror WWF’s audited financial statements. All bookable contributions, including cash and pledges received for future years, are reflected in the revenue shown. FY22 contributions revenue includes the bookable portion ($14 million) of our extraordinary partnership with HP, $16 million for the Heritage Colombia Projects for Permanence, and a $10 million gift for our Renewable Thermal Collaborative. When we receive these exceptional multiyear gifts, including the $100 million grant from the Bezos Earth Fund in FY21 for climate-focused funding, it may create the appearance of a large surplus of revenue over expenses in a given year. These contributions will be spent down over several years, which may result in the appearance of a deficit of operating revenue over operating expense in subsequent years.

Transparency and Accountability
WWF holds a deep commitment to transparency and accountability. We carefully manage our resources to maximize the funding that goes toward our science-driven program work. Donors will receive updates and communications from WWF and can opt-out at any time. 82% of WWF’s spending is directed to worldwide conservation activities, while 12% is utilized for fundraising and 6% goes toward finance and administration. We communicate with our supporters by postal mail and other channels to educate the public and advance the cause of conservation, as well as to generate income and maintain our membership base. As a result, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines, our direct mail costs are divided between public education to advance conservation and fundraising.
