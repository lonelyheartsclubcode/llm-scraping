2022 annual report energy in progress

The events of the past year have defined the energy challenge facing the world: meeting the energy demands of today while building the lower carbon energy system of tomorrow. This will require advancing technologies, accelerating solutions, harnessing the power of markets and unleashing human ingenuity. Progress depends on scalable solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy.
That’s Energy in Progress

to our stockholders“We believe Chevron is well positioned to lead in both traditional and new energy while safely delivering higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value. We’re at the center of one of the world’s greatest challenges – meeting the energy needs of a growing world and doing so in lower carbon ways. We are confident that by harnessing our human energy, we will continue to advance energy progress.”
Mike Wirth, Chairman and CEO, Chevron






asset class: deepwater










We are a leader in applying new technologies to tap into the oil that lies deep beneath the ocean floor and doing so in a lower carbon way. Our deepwater assets include fields offshore of Angola, Australia, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Nigeria and Republic of Congo and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with deepwater exploration activities ongoing offshore 12 countries. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities are some of the lowest carbon intensity producing assets in the world.

2022 annual report energy in progress

The events of the past year have defined the energy challenge facing the world: meeting the energy demands of today while building the lower carbon energy system of tomorrow. This will require advancing technologies, accelerating solutions, harnessing the power of markets and unleashing human ingenuity. Progress depends on scalable solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy.
That’s Energy in Progress

to our stockholders“We believe Chevron is well positioned to lead in both traditional and new energy while safely delivering higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value. We’re at the center of one of the world’s greatest challenges – meeting the energy needs of a growing world and doing so in lower carbon ways. We are confident that by harnessing our human energy, we will continue to advance energy progress.”
Mike Wirth, Chairman and CEO, Chevron






asset class: deepwater










We are a leader in applying new technologies to tap into the oil that lies deep beneath the ocean floor and doing so in a lower carbon way. Our deepwater assets include fields offshore of Angola, Australia, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Nigeria and Republic of Congo and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with deepwater exploration activities ongoing offshore 12 countries. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities are some of the lowest carbon intensity producing assets in the world.

2022 annual report energy in progress

The events of the past year have defined the energy challenge facing the world: meeting the energy demands of today while building the lower carbon energy system of tomorrow. This will require advancing technologies, accelerating solutions, harnessing the power of markets and unleashing human ingenuity. Progress depends on scalable solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy.
That’s Energy in Progress

to our stockholders“We believe Chevron is well positioned to lead in both traditional and new energy while safely delivering higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value. We’re at the center of one of the world’s greatest challenges – meeting the energy needs of a growing world and doing so in lower carbon ways. We are confident that by harnessing our human energy, we will continue to advance energy progress.”
Mike Wirth, Chairman and CEO, Chevron






asset class: deepwater










We are a leader in applying new technologies to tap into the oil that lies deep beneath the ocean floor and doing so in a lower carbon way. Our deepwater assets include fields offshore of Angola, Australia, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Nigeria and Republic of Congo and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with deepwater exploration activities ongoing offshore 12 countries. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities are some of the lowest carbon intensity producing assets in the world.

to our stockholders“We believe Chevron is well positioned to lead in both traditional and new energy while safely delivering higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value. We’re at the center of one of the world’s greatest challenges – meeting the energy needs of a growing world and doing so in lower carbon ways. We are confident that by harnessing our human energy, we will continue to advance energy progress.”

asset class: deepwater










We are a leader in applying new technologies to tap into the oil that lies deep beneath the ocean floor and doing so in a lower carbon way. Our deepwater assets include fields offshore of Angola, Australia, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Israel, Nigeria and Republic of Congo and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with deepwater exploration activities ongoing offshore 12 countries. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities are some of the lowest carbon intensity producing assets in the world.
